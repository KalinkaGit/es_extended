# REUPLOAD DUE TO DMCA TAKEDOWN (unofficial)
As you may know, the official es_extended repository has received a DMCA takedown from the creator of essentialmode (kanersps), 
this takedown will be deleted after two weeks if kanersps does not go to court. 
By reuploading this repository I'm not taking any part, I'm just a player and a developer who just want this project to be able 
to continue to be downloaded during the takedown. 
You won't see any updates here and when the sanction will be lifted or made permanent I will remove this repository. 
If you are kanersps and you wish to remove this repository too, please tell me on discord and I will remove it: Kalinka#4099

(this is the last version of esx) ENJOY!

# es_extended

es_extended is a roleplay framework for FiveM. ESX is short for EssentialMode Extended. The to-go framework for creating an economy based roleplay server on FiveM and most popular on the platform, too!

Featuring many extra resources to fit roleplaying servers, here's a taste of what's available:

- esx_ambulancejob: play as a medic to revive players who are bleeding out. Complete with garages and respawn & bleedout system
- esx_policejob: patrol the city and arrest players commiting crime, with armory, outfit room and garages
- esx_vehicleshop: roleplay working in an vehicle dealership where you sell cars to players

ESX was initially developed by Gizz back in 2017 for his friend as the were creating an FiveM server and there wasn't any economy roleplaying frameworks available. The original code was written within a week or two and later open sourced, it has ever since been improved and parts been rewritten to further improve on it.
